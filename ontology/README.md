# SciData Ontology

This SciData Ontology (SDO) is a semantic representation of the framework.  If you intend to store data in RDF, these terms are how you would semantically encode the framework relationships.  Take some of the examples on this site and put them in the JSON-LD playground (http://json-ld.org/playground/) to see what the conversion to RDF looks like (under the N-Quads tab).
